# rmelnet
Experimental dump of R-MelNet related code and demo files

See samples/melnet\_trunc\_pt33 for samples from the R-MelNet pipeline. tts\*.wav files represent the initial tts (generated via hts) that were used to extract the initial pronunciation / phonemization of the text.

Baseline comparisons for fastspeech2 and portaspeech were generated from their huggingface spaces, at https://huggingface.co/facebook/fastspeech2-en-ljspeech and https://huggingface.co/spaces/NATSpeech/PortaSpeech respectively. 

An experimental code dump will be released soon, followed by a pretrained model and notebook demo for sampling.
